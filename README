Week 3: Monte Carlo Simulation of Confidence Intervals

Purpose
This repository contains an R script for a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the validity of confidence intervals for the mean.

Steps Taken
1. Generated random samples from a normal distribution.
2. Calculated 95% confidence intervals for the sample mean.
3. Repeated the process 1000 times to estimate the proportion of intervals containing the true mean.

Results
The script reports the proportion of confidence intervals that include the true mean (coverage rate). The expected value for a 95% confidence level is approximately 0.95.
